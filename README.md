# Apple System Status
## iOS client application for AppleSystemStatus project
### Into
Ever wondered why Siri cannot process your commands, or iCloud Drive doesn't synchronize your files, even though your Internet connection seems to work? Probably, one or more Apple services have issues or even experience outage? Now there's an app exactly for that!
### Basics
The app shows current health status of all available Apple services supported in the particular country. You can check event details such as what and when happened, how many users affected and if related services are also unhealthy. Historical data is supported as well.
### Details
How does it work? The service behind the app checks the official Apple system status page for the particular region (e.g. https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus) every minute, so you always have up-to-date service state. Note, that status updates are maintained by Apple support and may not published in real time.
